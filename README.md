# Stereo Tool LADSPA Plugin

This project provides a LADSPA wrapper for [Thimeo Stereo Tool](https://www.thimeo.com/stereo-tool/), enabling integration of its broadcast-grade audio processing into LADSPA-compatible hosts.

## üéõ Features

* Wraps `libStereoTool_intel64.so` into a LADSPA plugin
* Accepts stereo input/output
* Loads a `settings.sts` preset at runtime from the same directory
* Written in C with a C++ wrapper for compatibility

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to the limited parameter passing capabilities of the LADSPA interface, the path to the configuration file (`settings.sts`) is currently hardcoded to the same directory as the plugin `.so` file.

---

## üîß Installation

1. Download "x86/64 Linux libStereoTool plugin" from [Thimeo](https://www.thimeo.com/stereo-tool/download/). Put the included `libStereoTool_intel64.so` (this is for 64 bit hosts, 32 bit and ARM are also available) into the library search path and run `ldconfig`
2. Clone this repo and run:

```bash
make
make install
```

3. Ensure your LADSPA host (like `ecasound`, `liquidsoap`, or `Audacity`) can discover the `.so` file:

```bash
export LADSPA_PATH=~/.ladspa
```

## üîÑ Configuration

Place a `settings.sts` file (exported from Stereo Tool GUI) in the same directory as `stereotool_ladspa.so`. This will be auto-loaded at startup.

You can download or generate your own `.sts` config using [Stereo Tool GUI](https://www.thimeo.com/stereo-tool/).
